# IoT Cloud Developer 2020
**_Exercises Guide Overview_**

This course includes the following exercises:

### Exercise 1. Designing an IoT solution
In this exercise, students design an IoT solution by specifying IoT components that are necessary to build a facility management system. Students discover how Watson IoT Platform can help transform traditional facility management systems.

[Go to Exercise 1. Designing an IoT solution](SAIOT2EX01-Design.md)
### Exercise 3. Creating an application to monitor room temperature and humidity
In this exercise, you create an IoT system by using IBM Watson IoT Platform. The purpose of the system is to monitor the temperature and humidity of a facility and optimize the use of air conditioning. You use the Watson IoT Platform device simulator to simulate the devices that send temperature and humidity values through the internet to Watson IoT Platform. Finally, you visualize the data that is sent by the devices in real time by using the dashboard.
