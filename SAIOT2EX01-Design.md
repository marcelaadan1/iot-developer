# Designing an IoT Solution

[[_TOC_]]

#### Estimated time

01:00

### Overview

In this exercise, students design a complete Internet of Things (IoT)
solution by using IBM Watson IoT Platform.

### Objectives

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

  - Select the IoT sensors that best match the IoT overall solution.

  - Identify the best possible ways to connect an IoT device to Watson
    IoT Platform.

  - Explain how the data that is sent from an IoT device can be managed
    and used by Watson IoT Platform.

## Introduction

In this exercise, students must design (specify) the IoT components that
are necessary to build a facility management system. Students discover
how Watson IoT Platform can help transform traditional facility
management systems.

## Requirements

Only paper and pen.

## Exercise instructions

In this exercise, you complete the following tasks:

1. [ ] Choose the IoT devices that you need to build the facility
    management system.

1. [ ] Specify the IoT devices network topology.

1. [ ]  Explain how the data is managed and used.

1. [ ]  Identify the type of analytics that can be applied on the collected
    data to deliver better business value.

## _Part 1. Choosing IoT devices_

Answer to the following questions help you choose the IoT device that
you use in your solution:

1.  What is the overall expected value that your solution provides?

2.  What are the constraints that might affect the device choice? For
    example, are there any power consumption constraints? Are there
    networking issues like unavailability of wireless signals?

3.  How frequently must the device send the data to the platform to
    provide effective measurements for proper functioning?

## _Part 2. Specifying the IoT devices network topology_

In this part, specify how the devices are connected to the internet:

1.  Are you going to connect the device directly to the platform by
    using, for example, a mobile network? Or do you need to connect
    devices to a gateway so that devices can be connected to the
    platform?

2.  What communication protocols are you planning to use, for example,
    Bluetooth Low Energy or wifi?

## _Part 3. Explaining how data is managed and used_

In this part, describe how data is stored and updated:

1.  How is the data stored in the platform and how frequently is it
    updated?

## _Part 4. Identifying the types of analytics that can be applied on the collected data to deliver better business value_

In this part, identify the types of analytics that can be applied on the collected data. Consider applying Streaming Analytics, predictive analytics, or any other type of analytics that you think it can deliver business value from your solution. 

1.  How can you use the collected data to deliver better business value?

## Exercise review and wrap-up

This exercise provided a closer look at designing the main components
that are required for an IoT solution. You discovered how AI APIs can
help transform traditional IT solutions.
